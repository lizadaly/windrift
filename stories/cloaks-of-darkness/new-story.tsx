                Start a new session of <em>Cloaks of Darkness</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is a simple two-player hypertext story based on the <i>Cloak of Darkness</i>{' '}
                interactive fiction game meant to demonstrate the multiplayer functionality of the
                hypertext library <a href="https://windrift.app">Windrift</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each person will play the role of a different character. The story is cooperative,
                so you'll be working together to bring things to a happy conclusion. There is no way
                to lose and a typical session takes about 10 minutes.
