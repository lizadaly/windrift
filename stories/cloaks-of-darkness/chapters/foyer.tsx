                            Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the
                            bright lights of the Opera House—always a reliable source of foods
                            scraps from its attached bar and restaurant. Your fur is soaked and
                            you're starving!

                            It's surprising that there aren't more people about but you're a raccoon
                            and you take what you get. And what you want to get tonight is some
                            delicious trash.

                        This is a tragedy! The humans must've finally caught on that you've been
                        scurrying into the bar and stealing from the garbage. You won't be able to
                        complete this mission alone.

                                    bottom corner, a few inches in diameter.
