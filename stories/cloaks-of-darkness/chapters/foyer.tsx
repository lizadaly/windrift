                                            you, and look steadily at the raccoon. Strange
                                            bedfellows, but it's a strange night at the opera.

                                            You delicately pull the screwdriver from the snake's
                                            tail (are corn snakes venomous?) and pry the bottom
                                            board off the doorway. It's great to have hands!

                                            The raccoon politely extracts the screwdriver from your
                                            tail's grasp and, almost like a human, pries the lowest
                                            board off the doorway. Now you can both fit through.
