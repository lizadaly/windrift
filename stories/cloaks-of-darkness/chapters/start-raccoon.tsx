                            Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the
                            bright lights of the Opera Houseâ€”always a reliable source of food scraps
                            from its attached bar and restaurant. Your fur is thoroughly soaked and
                            you're starving!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's surprising that there aren't more people about but you're a raccoon
                            and you don't much care for people anyway. They tend to take offense
                            when you're just in search of some delicious trash to eat!
