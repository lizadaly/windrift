                    Whenever a user selects an option from a <code>Choice</code>, the option text is
                    added to a global store called the <code>Inventory</code>. The inventory is a
                    key/value store where the keys are each choice's <code>tag</code> attribute. The
                    inventory for a tag is usually unpopulated until the user has selected an
                    option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the inventory is global to the entire story, you can retrieve any{' '}
                    <code>Choice</code>'s selection from any chapter. Back in the initial{' '}
                    <Nav text="chapter on choices" next="choices" />, you picked a fruitâ€”we'll use

                <p>
                    There are two common ways to retrieve the value from the inventory. One is to
                    use the <code>useInventory</code>{' '}
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React hook</a> to retrieve
                    the raw value selected by the user. The other is to use the{' '}
                    <code>Response</code> component to map specific inventory selections to
                    responses.

                <p>
                    Given an array of tags, <code>useInventory</code> returns an array of the
                    current values of those tags. (Because it's a React hook that listens to the
                    global store, this value will update automatically whenever the values change,
                    such as when a user makes a different choice.){' '}

                <p>
                    Often the option selected will have as its raw value an entire noun phrase
                    including descriptive adjectives, when in the narrative you may want to only
                    show the noun. In English, this is typically the last word in the phrase. The
                    utility function <code>wordFromInventory</code> retrieves a specific word based
                    on a negative offset from the end of the string (defaulting to -1), and is safe
                    to use even if the inventory value is undefined. The offset value applies to
                    every option in the choice, so if you're planning on using this you'll either
                    want options with similar structure, or a custom rendering function:

                    Because a <code>Response</code> match can be any React node, you can branch from

                    The <code>options</code> map is optional; omitting it will just return the

                    <code>useInventory</code> hook but can be called in contexts where hooks are
                    inconvenient or disallowed.

                    display any child contents; otherwise, if the <em>optional</em> prop{' '}
                    <code>otherwise</code> is passed, use that node instead.

                    Be aware that if you write a <code>Choice</code> that includes a{' '}

                    narrative effect. A design principle of Windrift is that it should always be
