                    Windrift is expected to be under active development throughout 2022. Keep an eye
                    on the project <a href="https://github.com/lizadaly/windrift#readme">README</a>{' '}
                    for any new release info and an updated roadmap.

                <p>
                    Windrift will not be released as an npm installable library (because it's
                    intertwined with the NextJS framework) nor is it planned to be a{' '}
